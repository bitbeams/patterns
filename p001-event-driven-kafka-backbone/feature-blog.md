# Kafka Main–Retry–DLQ Pattern: Feature Overview & Implementation Guide

A Kafka-based event-driven backbone is a foundational architecture for building scalable, decoupled, and resilient systems. By leveraging Kafka as a central event bus, organizations can enable asynchronous communication between microservices, ensure reliable message delivery, and support real-time data processing at scale. This approach is widely adopted in modern cloud-native and data-driven applications, providing the flexibility to handle high-throughput workloads, implement sophisticated retry and error-handling strategies, and maintain operational visibility across distributed components.

## Feature Overview
This solution implements robust, fault-tolerant event processing in Apache Kafka using the main–retry–DLQ pattern:
- **orders.v1**: Main topic for new order events.
- **orders.retry**: Holds events that failed initial processing and require another attempt.
- **orders.dlq**: Dead Letter Queue for events that could not be processed after multiple retries.

### How It Works
1. **Main Flow**: Orders are produced to `orders.v1`. A consumer processes each event. If successful, processing ends here.
2. **Retry Logic**: If processing fails (e.g., due to a transient error), the event is sent to `orders.retry`. A retry consumer attempts to process these events, with a configurable number of retries.
3. **Dead Letter Queue**: If an event fails all retry attempts, it is moved to `orders.dlq` for manual inspection and intervention.

### Benefits
- **Resilience**: Automatic retries for transient failures.
- **Transparency**: Clear event flow and error handling.
- **Safety**: No message is lost; all failures are captured.
- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand, maintain, and extend.

## Feature Implementation
This codebase provides a production-ready, automated implementation of the above pattern, including infrastructure, automation, and applications.

### 1. Infrastructure as Code
- **Terraform** provisions cloud resources (VMs, networking, security).
- **Ansible** automates server configuration, Docker/Kafka installation, and app deployment.

### 2. Kafka Event Backbone
- **Kafka (Docker Compose)** provides the event streaming platform.
- **Redpanda Console** offers a web UI for topic/message inspection.
- **Topics**: `orders.v1`, `orders.retry`, `orders.dlq` are created and managed automatically.

### 3. Applications
- **Producer App**: Publishes order events to `orders.v1` with traceable headers.
- **Main Consumer**: Processes `orders.v1`, forwarding failures to `orders.retry`.
- **Retry Consumer**: Processes `orders.retry`, forwarding after max attempts to `orders.dlq`.
- **Web UI (Flask)**: Allows message production and real-time monitoring of all topics, with auto-refreshing tables.

### 4. Automation & Operations
- **Systemd services** ensure consumers and UI restart on failure.
- **Makefile** targets orchestrate full-stack deployment and teardown.
- **Logs and monitoring** are available via systemd, Redpanda Console, and the web UI.

## Example Workflow
1. Order event is produced to `orders.v1` (via UI or script).
2. Main consumer fails to process (e.g., payment timeout) → event moves to `orders.retry`.
3. Retry consumer processes the event. If it succeeds, the workflow ends. If it fails after max retries, the event is sent to `orders.dlq`.
4. Operations or support teams review DLQ events for resolution.

## Getting Started
1. **Provision infrastructure** with Terraform.
2. **Deploy and configure** with Ansible.
3. **Access the web UI** and Redpanda Console to produce and monitor messages.
4. **Monitor and troubleshoot** using logs and dashboards.

## Conclusion
This feature delivers a reliable, observable, and maintainable event-driven backbone using Kafka, suitable for modern microservices and data-driven architectures. It is easily adaptable for new domains and requirements, supporting both operational excellence and customer satisfaction.
